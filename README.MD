# Sorting Algorithms

Bubble and merge sorts are much faster than the native JavaScript sort.  

#### Bubble sort 
Bubble sort looks over the elements, swaps anything that is out of order, and repeats until it is finished.

space complexity: O(1)

time complexity: O(n^2)

#### Merge sort 
Merge sort divides an array of N elements into N arrays of 1 element, merges adjacent arrays in sorted order, and repeats until it is finished.

space complexity: O(n)

time complexity: O(n * log(n))
