# Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble and merge sorts are much faster than the native JavaScript sort.  

### Bubble sort looks over the elements, swaps anything that is out of order, and repeats until it is finished.

#### Merge sort divides an array of N elements into N arrays of 1 element, merges adjacent arrays in sorted order, and repeats until it is finished.

#### Bubble sort space complexity: O(1)
#### Bubble sort time complexity: O(n^2)

#### Merge sort 


space complexity: O(n)
time complexity: O(n * log(n))
